# Sadra Milani - Developer Portfolio Active Context

## Current Work Focus

About section implementation with Lottie animation integration nearly complete. All major implementation tasks finished - HTML structure updated, CSS styling modified, JavaScript integration completed, and responsive design adjusted. Hero section styling has been enhanced with larger image sizing (600px) and CSS has been reorganized for better maintainability. Only final testing of Lottie animation performance and accessibility remains.

## Project Status

The hero section is fully implemented with GSAP typing animation. The About section is nearly complete with Lottie animation integration - all major implementation tasks finished except final testing. Ready to proceed with Projects section after About section testing is complete.

4. Add navigation system for smooth scrolling between sections
5. Test across devices and browsers
6. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance and simplicity
- Implementing GSAP for modern animations and scroll-triggered effects
- Focusing on lightweight, fast-loading design
- Ensuring mobile-first responsive approach
- Planning semantic HTML structure for accessibility
- Considering performance optimization from the start

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Clean, modern design aesthetic with Inter font family
- Smooth animations and transitions (hover effects, GSAP typing animation, Lottie animations)
- Fast loading times as priority
- Mobile-first responsive design with CSS Grid (desktop) and Flexbox (mobile)
- Accessible markup and interactions (focus states, reduced motion support)
- Professional color scheme and typography (Inter 300-700 weights)
- GSAP for professional-grade animations (typing effect, scroll triggers)
- Lottie animations for rich visual content (About section integration)
- Minimal dependencies for reliability (GSAP and Lottie Web added)
- Semantic HTML structure with BEM-style class naming
- CSS custom properties for maintainable styling
- Animation accessibility with prefers-reduced-motion support
- Responsive animation sizing (500px desktop, 400px tablet, 350px mobile)
- Organized CSS architecture with separation of concerns (styles.css for base styles, responsive.css for breakpoints)
- Scalable hero image sizing (600px base with responsive scaling: 450px tablet, 320px mobile, 280px small mobile)

## Learnings & Project Insights

- This project serves as both a portfolio and a demonstration of technical skills
- Performance is critical for making a good first impression
- Animations should enhance rather than distract from content (subtle hover effects, typing animation, and Lottie animations work well)
- Mobile experience is as important as desktop experience (responsive animation sizing is crucial)
- The portfolio itself is a showcase of frontend development skills
- Google Fonts (Inter) significantly improve typography and professional appearance
- GSAP provides professional-grade animation capabilities with excellent performance
- Lottie animations offer rich visual content that scales well across devices
- Typing animations create engaging first impressions when implemented thoughtfully
- Accessibility features should be built-in from the start, not added later (prefers-reduced-motion is crucial)
- User feedback is valuable for design refinements (animation size adjustments improve visual impact)
- Local development server is essential for real-time testing and validation
- Animation timing and character styling require careful consideration for optimal user experience
- GSAP timeline management allows for complex animation sequences with precise control
- Lottie integration requires careful consideration of container sizing and responsive behavior
- ScrollTrigger integration with Lottie animations provides smooth user experience
- Replacing static content with dynamic animations significantly enhances visual appeal
