# Sadra Milani - Developer Portfolio Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Hero section implementation completed with GSAP typing animation. Ready to move to next portfolio component.

## Project Status

The hero section is fully implemented with HTML structure, desktop CSS styling, mobile-responsive design, and accessibility features. Typography has been enhanced with Google Fonts (Inter). The project is ready for the next component implementation.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ Implemented hero section HTML structure with semantic markup
- ✅ Added desktop CSS styling with 50/50 layout (text left, image right)
- ✅ Implemented mobile-first responsive design (image stacked above text)
- ✅ Integrated Google Font (Inter) for improved typography
- ✅ Added accessibility features (focus states, reduced motion, high contrast)
- ✅ Removed box shadows from hero image per user request
- ✅ Set up local development server for testing
- ✅ Implemented GSAP typing animation for hero title
- ✅ Added GSAP CDN integration to project
- ✅ Created animations.js with typing animation logic
- ✅ Enhanced hero title with "Hi, my name is Sadra." typing effect
- ✅ Added cursor blinking animation with GSAP
- ✅ Styled "Sadra" name in black and bold within animation
- ✅ Implemented accessibility support for reduced motion preferences

## Next Steps

1. Add CSS styling and responsive design
2. Implement JavaScript functionality and GSAP animations
3. Test across devices and browsers
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance and simplicity
- Implementing GSAP for modern animations and scroll-triggered effects
- Focusing on lightweight, fast-loading design
- Ensuring mobile-first responsive approach
- Planning semantic HTML structure for accessibility
- Considering performance optimization from the start

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Clean, modern design aesthetic with Inter font family
- Smooth animations and transitions (hover effects on images, GSAP typing animation)
- Fast loading times as priority
- Mobile-first responsive design with CSS Grid (desktop) and Flexbox (mobile)
- Accessible markup and interactions (focus states, reduced motion support)
- Professional color scheme and typography (Inter 300-700 weights)
- GSAP for professional-grade animations (typing effect, future scroll triggers)
- Minimal dependencies for reliability (only GSAP added)
- Semantic HTML structure with BEM-style class naming
- CSS custom properties for maintainable styling
- Animation accessibility with prefers-reduced-motion support

## Learnings & Project Insights

- This project serves as both a portfolio and a demonstration of technical skills
- Performance is critical for making a good first impression
- Animations should enhance rather than distract from content (subtle hover effects and typing animation work well)
- Mobile experience is as important as desktop experience (image stacking pattern works effectively)
- The portfolio itself is a showcase of frontend development skills
- Google Fonts (Inter) significantly improve typography and professional appearance
- GSAP provides professional-grade animation capabilities with excellent performance
- Typing animations create engaging first impressions when implemented thoughtfully
- Accessibility features should be built-in from the start, not added later (prefers-reduced-motion is crucial)
- User feedback is valuable for design refinements (black/bold styling for name improved readability)
- Local development server is essential for real-time testing and validation
- Animation timing and character styling require careful consideration for optimal user experience
- GSAP timeline management allows for complex animation sequences with precise control
