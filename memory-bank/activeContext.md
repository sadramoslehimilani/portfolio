# Sadra Milani - Developer Portfolio Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Initial project setup and memory bank creation for the developer portfolio website. Establishing the foundational documentation structure and planning the implementation approach.

## Project Status

This is a new project with no existing files. The memory bank is being created as the first step in the development process.

## Recent Changes

- Created project brief documentation
- Created product context documentation
- No code files exist yet

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining memory bank documentation files
2. Plan the technical architecture and file structure
3. Begin implementing the HTML structure
4. Add CSS styling and responsive design
5. Implement JavaScript functionality and GSAP animations
6. Test across devices and browsers
7. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance and simplicity
- Implementing GSAP for modern animations and scroll-triggered effects
- Focusing on lightweight, fast-loading design
- Ensuring mobile-first responsive approach
- Planning semantic HTML structure for accessibility

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Clean, modern design aesthetic
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Fast loading times as priority

- Minimal dependencies for reliability

## Learnings & Project Insights

- This project serves as both a portfolio and a demonstration of technical skills
- Performance is critical for making a good first impression
- Animations should enhance rather than distract from content
- Mobile experience is as important as desktop experience
- The portfolio itself is a showcase of frontend development skills
