- Ensuring mobile-first responsive approach
- Planning semantic HTML structure for accessibility
- Considering performance optimization from the start

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Clean, modern design aesthetic with Inter font family
- Smooth animations and transitions (hover effects, GSAP typing animation, Lottie animations)
- Fast loading times as priority
- Mobile-first responsive design with CSS Grid (desktop) and Flexbox (mobile)
- Accessible markup and interactions (focus states, reduced motion support)

- Minimal dependencies for reliability (GSAP and Lottie Web added)
- Semantic HTML structure with BEM-style class naming
- CSS custom properties for maintainable styling
- Animation accessibility with prefers-reduced-motion support

- Optimized typography hierarchy with reduced font sizes across all sections for better readability
- Showcase section with responsive grid layout and compact image containers
- Inline tech stack display using flexbox for better visual organization
- Consistent font size scaling across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints

## Learnings & Project Insights

- This project serves as both a portfolio and a demonstration of technical skills
- Performance is critical for making a good first impression
- Animations should enhance rather than distract from content (subtle hover effects, typing animation, and Lottie animations work well)
- Mobile experience is as important as desktop experience (responsive animation sizing is crucial)
- The portfolio itself is a showcase of frontend development skills
- Google Fonts (Inter) significantly improve typography and professional appearance
- GSAP provides professional-grade animation capabilities with excellent performance
- Lottie animations offer rich visual content that scales well across devices
- Typing animations create engaging first impressions when implemented thoughtfully
- Accessibility features should be built-in from the start, not added later (prefers-reduced-motion is crucial)
- User feedback is valuable for design refinements (animation size adjustments improve visual impact)
- Local development server is essential for real-time testing and validation
- Animation timing and character styling require careful consideration for optimal user experience
- GSAP timeline management allows for complex animation sequences with precise control
- Lottie integration requires careful consideration of container sizing and responsive behavior
- ScrollTrigger integration with Lottie animations provides smooth user experience
- Replacing static content with dynamic animations significantly enhances visual appeal
