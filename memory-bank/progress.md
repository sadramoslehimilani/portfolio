- Chose GSAP for professional animation capabilities
- Planned mobile-first responsive design
- Selected single-page architecture for simplicity
- Opted for GitHub Pages deployment for cost-free hosting

### Future Considerations

- May add more advanced animations based on implementation progress
- Could extend to multi-page if content becomes too extensive
- Might consider adding a blog section in future iterations
- Could integrate with portfolio management tools if needed
